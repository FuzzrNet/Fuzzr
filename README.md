# Fuzzr

Fuzzr is a censorship-resistant p2p content publishing and viewing platform. At some point, a cryptocurrency miner will be added, so as to assist in monetization, distribution, and incentivizing privacy measures.

It's also a massive work in progress. More thoughts in the notes directory.

This repo contains an implementation of Fuzzr that is architected to serve only a single client (c1). As opposed to c10k, an application meant to serve 10,000, as traditional web apps are generally designed for.

This is an architecture for an actual locally-run p2p app, not a simple web-based "decentralized app".

Built with Rust, for native desktop platforms, using [iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) for UI and [embedded IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/ipfs-embed/).
