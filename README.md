# Fuzzr (c1)

Fuzzr is a p2p content publishing platform.

This repo contains an implementation of Fuzzr that is architected to serve only a single client (c1). As opposed to c10k, an application meant to serve 10,000, as traditional web apps are generally designed for.

This is an architecture for an actual locally-run p2p app, not just a web dapp.

Built with rust, for native desktop platforms, using iced and embedded ipfs.
